**Project B: Places Attribute Conflation**

## Project Information
**Team Member(s):** Jayden Chan

## Project Description
When multiple data sources describe the same real-world place, their attributes (names, addresses, phone numbers, categories) often conflict due to typos, outdated information, or varying data collection standards. Precision-Places develops an intelligent, automated decision system to select the most accurate attribute from conflicting sources, ensuring Overture Maps' place data maintains the highest quality.

This project will create a labeled ground-truth dataset, develop and compare attribute selection algorithms (both rule-based and machine learning approaches), and rigorously evaluate their performance to recommend the optimal conflation strategy for production deployment.
